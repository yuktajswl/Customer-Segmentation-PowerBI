# Amazon Customer Segmentation & Insights Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting Amazon customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering techniques. It also provides business insights through interactive visualizations in Power BI.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering on Amazon product review data.
- Customer segmentation using KMeans clustering.
- Visualization of customer segments and insights using Power BI.
- Integration with SQLite for storing segmentation results.
- Exported clustered data for dashboard reporting.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- SQLite (for storing segmentation results)
- Power BI (for interactive dashboard creation)
- Jupyter Notebook for data processing

## Project Workflow
1. Load and clean Amazon review data.
2. Perform feature engineering (e.g., annual income, spending score simulation).
3. Apply KMeans clustering for customer segmentation.
4. Save results to SQLite and export as CSV.
5. Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-customer-segmentation-insights-dashboard.git
